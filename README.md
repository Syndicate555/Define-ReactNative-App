# Summary of the Application
Défine is a social media platform that provides challenges for youth, which are composed of tasks which encourage youth to do good for their community and the environment around them. For example, a challenge may be titled "Earth Day 2020," and some tasks associated with this challenge may include "picking up 50 pieces of trash" or "shopping with reusable bags." The challenge participants retrieve proof (which may be an image, video, etc.) and send it to the challenge hosts, who review the image/footage (in the order they were submitted) and decide whether or not the user has successfully/sufficiently completed the challenge.

The challenge hosts/judges decide collectively on a winner, which they may choose based on the user with the most creative submissions, or the user who completed all tasks the fastest. At the end, the winning participant may recieve a prize and attention/recognition for their actions (as they are ranked higher on the final leaderboard), which is a big incentive for many youth.

Défine replicates many elements of a typcial social media site, such as the ability to follow others and to have a profile that summarizes one's past challenges. The ability to follow others encourages friends to join challenges together, encouraging youth to do good for their community/environment with friends. The profile allows people to view each other's progress and challenges they've completed, and with our app, a developed profile is something that one can be proud of, as it means that you've done a lot of good for the community and the environment.

Each challenge also comes with a challenge chat, where participants can connect with others sharing the same passions as them. The chat will be heavily moderated, because once again, this platform is about bringing the best of social media into one place and combining them with a purpose of a positive impact in our world, and the chat for making connections should be a comfortable place to chat in. This challenge chat should only strive to make connections for the greater good, where users can connect with individual users if they would like to chat more informally.
